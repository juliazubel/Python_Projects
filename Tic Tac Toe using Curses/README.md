# Tic Tac Toe game using Curses library

This project is a game of TicTacToe but not just in a normal terminal.

To make it more advanced and fun I used a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard to play - thanks to 'curses' library

HOW TO PLAY:
- 'W' or arrow up - to move the cursor up
- 'S' or arrow down - to move the cursor down
- 'A' or arrow left - to move the cursor left
- 'D' or arrow right - to move the cursor right
- 'B' - to place appropriately O or X in the selected position
- 'R' - to restart the game
- 'Q' - to quit the game
