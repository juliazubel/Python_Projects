# Development of cheminformatics software using SMILES notation and RDKit library

The development of specialised software tools with the ever-increasing amount of data in the fields of chemistry and biology is crucial to analyse it well and faster. Using cheminformatics notations such as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) and specialised libraries such as RDKit[1], such tools can be developed. The software described offers a user- friendly solution for analysing and preparing data for molecular pre-modelling. Solutions to three programming tasks are demonstrated: conversion from SMILES to PDB, identification of the largest common substructures and object-oriented processing of molecular data. Example applications of the developed software are presented for several selected biologically active molecules.
